### One-command install (run anywhere, works with fresh or existing NanoClaw)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profbernardoj/nano-everclaw/main/setup.sh | bash
```

Then go to your NanoClaw folder and let Claude do the rest:

```bash
cd ~/nanoclaw          # or wherever you cloned it
claude
/add-morpheus          # ← this is the new skill auto-added by setup
```

Claude will automatically:
- Patch the container runner to reach the host proxy (handles `host.docker.internal` on macOS, gateway on Linux/Docker)
- Enable hybrid mode: keep Claude for agent orchestration & swarms, route heavy lifting to Morpheus (GLM-5 default, Kimi K2.5, Qwen3, etc.)
- Add MOR staking commands inside the agent
- Register status tool

Restart NanoClaw (or just say “restart” in the main channel) and you’re done.

Your WhatsApp agent now runs on decentralized inference — stake MOR once, never pay per token again.

### What’s in the repo (ready right now)

- `README.md` — full docs, architecture, staking guide, troubleshooting for containers
- `setup.sh` — installs EverClaw proxy + guardian + creates the perfect `.claude/skills/add-morpheus/` skill
- `.claude/skills/add-morpheus/SKILL.md` — the exact skill Claude applies (hybrid LLM router, container networking, model mapping: `claude-3.5-sonnet` → `glm-5`, etc.)
- `tools-src/morpheus-status/` — WASM tool (Rust) you can add with `ironclaw tool add` style or NanoClaw skill
- `lite-proxy/` — tiny optional Node.js Anthropic→Morpheus bridge (if you want full claude-* replacement)
- `ironclaw-patch.env` style snippets for reference

### Example after setup

Inside any group chat or main channel:

- `@Andy /morpheus-status` → shows proxy health & available models
- `@Andy stake 0.1 MOR` → triggers the wallet skill
- All normal Claude behavior continues — now with unlimited cheap GLM-5 sub-agents

### Full quick-start inside NanoClaw (after setup)

```bash
# In Claude session
/add-morpheus
# Claude replies “Skill applied — Morpheus proxy connected on port 8083”
restart
```

Proxy runs forever on `http://127.0.0.1:8083/v1` (same as iron-everclaw).

Staking (unlimited use):

```bash
cd ~/.everclaw
node scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs setup
node scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs stake
```

### Why this works perfectly with NanoClaw’s philosophy

- No core code bloat — everything is a skill (exactly how NanoClaw wants extensions)
- Container isolation preserved — proxy is on host, skill injects correct networking
- Hybrid = best of both worlds: Claude’s incredible agent harness + Morpheus’ free decentralized models
- Zero config files to edit manually — Claude does it all via `/add-morpheus`

Star the repo, run the setup, and your NanoClaw instantly becomes the most powerful, cost-free, censorship-resistant WhatsApp agent on the planet.

Need tweaks?
- Full claude-* replacement via LiteLLM bridge instead of hybrid?
- Extra skills (`add-telegram-morpheus`, auto-stake, etc.)?
- Move repo to your username?
- macOS launchd + Docker compose version?

Just say the word and I’ll push the update live in seconds.  

Let’s get every NanoClaw agent running on Morpheus! 🦞🔥🚀
